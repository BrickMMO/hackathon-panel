[BrickMMO](http://brickmmo.com/) needs your help making a control panel for the [BrickMMO](https://brickmmo.com/) Smart City. 

The goal of this hackathon is to design a visually striking, ergonomically sound, control panel that satisfies the specifications provided by the Web Development students. This control panl will allow observers to interact with the BrickMMO Smart City built with LEGO® bricks:

 - Open and cloase the lifting bridge
 - Turn on and off the train
 - Turn on and off the lighting
 - Drive a car around town

## Design Criteria

When designing the control panel, take into account the following:

- Your final deliverables for this hackathon are your renderings (3D CAD and technical drawings).
- The final control panel will be built with LEGO® bricks. Keep this in mind, but don’t let this limit your imagination.
- Check out the smart city built with LEGO® bricks. Use it for some inspiration. 
- Design must address human factors and consider Universal Design, i.e. be comfortable to use, not **hostile**.
- You will present your deliverables in a short two minute presentation at the end of the hackathon. 
- Make sure you take into account the control panel specifications provided by the Web Development program.

## Suggestions

Keep in mind the following:

- PLAY! This is a realistic project but should be approached from outside the box.
- Make sure you think about the end user and user environment.

## Panel Components

Students from the Web Development program will be writing the code for the control panel and determining how many switches, dials, and buttons the panel will have. Here are the required buttons, levers, and inputs as well as their hierarchy:

- Main power switch
  - 1 cartridge slot
  - 1 XY joystick control
  - 1 dial
  - 3 buttons
 
### Main Power Switch (1st tier)

This will act as the city's main power switch. This will turn the complete city on and off. If the main power switch if off, all systems in the city will shut down and all other control panel components will be inactive.

### Cartridge Slot (2nd tier(

This will act much like the cartidge slot of a video game system. We will create approximately eight cartridges. They will each be correlated to a system: roads, power, trains, etc... The function of the third tier components (XY controller, dials, buttons) will be correlated to the cartridge. For example, If the **roads** cartridge is inserted, the first button might control a lifting bridge, if the trains cartrige is inserted, the same button could control a train turnout.

### XY Controller, Dial, and Buttons (3rd tier)

Based on the current cartrideg, these components function will change. 

## Steps

This hackathon will span one approximate five hour session. 

1) Everyone will receive a quick introduction to the BrickMMO project and a tour of the Smart City. 

2) We will discuss the control panel requirements. You will have a chance to ask any questions to the project researchers and students from the Web Development program. 
  
3) In groups, you will use your preferred methond to design and mockup the control panel. This can include sketches or renderings.

4) Each groups will have approximately 5 minutes to present their concept and a winning group will be chosen. The winning group will receive one of the many LEGO® GWP kits.
