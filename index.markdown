[BrickMMO](http://brickmmo.com/) needs your help making a control panel for the [BrickMMO](https://brickmmo.com/) Smart City. 

The goal of this hackathon is to design a visually striking, ergonomically sound, control panel that satisfies the specifications provided by the Web Development students. This control panl will allow observers to interact with the BrickMMO Smart City built with LEGO® bricks:

 - Open and cloase the lifting bridge
 - Turn on and off the train
 - Turn on and off the lighting
 - Drive a car around town

## Design Criteria

When designing the control panel, take into account the following:

- Your final deliverables for this hackathon are your renderings (3D CAD and technical drawings).
- The final control panel will be built with LEGO® bricks. Keep this in mind, but don’t let this limit your imagination.
- Check out the smart city built with LEGO® bricks. Use it for some inspiration. 
- Design must address human factors and consider Universal Design, i.e. be comfortable to use, not **hostile**.
- You will present your deliverables in a short two minute presentation at the end of the hackathon. 
- Make sure you take into account the control panel specifications provided by the Web Development program.

## Suggestions

Keep in mind the following:

- PLAY! This is a realistic project but should be approached from outside the box.
- Make sure you think about the end user and user environment.

## Panel Components

Students from the Web Development program will be writing the code for the control panel and determining how many switches, dials, and buttons the panel will have. Here are the required buttons, levers, and inputs as well as their hierarchy:

- Main power switch
  - 1 cartridge slot
  - 1 XY joystick control
  - 1 dial
  - 3 buttons
 
### Main Power Switch (1st tier)

This will act as the city's main power switch. This will turn the complete city on and off. If the main power switch if off, all systems in the city will shut down and all other control panel components will be inactive.

### Cartridge Slot (2nd tier(

This will act much like the cartidge slot of a video game system. We will create approximately eight cartridges. They will each be correlated to a system: roads, power, trains, etc... The function of the third tier components (XY controller, dials, buttons) will be correlated to the cartridge. For example, If the **roads** cartridge is inserted, the first button might control a lifting bridge, if the trains cartrige is inserted, the same button could control a train turnout.

### XY Controller, Dial, and Buttons (3rd tier)

Based on the current cartrideg, these components function will change. 

## Steps

This hackathon will span one approximate five hour session. 

Your goal is do design a visually striking, ergonomically sound, control panel that satisfies the specifications provided by the Web Development students. 



One three hour session for shooting. This will take place at Humber in the Virtual Propduction room CTI307. One three hour session for editing. This will take place during a regular class. And finally a short 20 minute session to present the videos and choose a winner!

### Day One: Shooting

1) Watch the sample video multiple times. Pay attention to the lighting, sounds, camera placement, timing, etc...

2) Choose a LEGO® Brickheadz™ kit provided by your instructor.

4) Prepare your photo environment. Use the following setup:

5) Shoot the video. Include the following shots:

  - Dropping the kit into the frame
  - Opening the box using a box cutter
  - Dumping out the contents of the box
  - Dumping out the contents of one of the bags
  - Looking through the instructions
  - Bulding the LEGO® kit (about 12 shots)
  - The completed LEGO® kit on the table
  - The original LEGO® box
  - The compelted LEGO® kit in your hand

### Day Two: Editing

1) Download the original [Adobe Premiere] file. 

2) Import your shots into the Premiere file.

3) Attempt to replicate the original video as close as possible. 

4) Export your video as a 1080 pixel wide x 1920 pixel high vertical video.

## Submission and Presentation

When you have completed the video, Zip up your Adobe Premiere file and final video and email them to your instructor. 

Once we have received all video submissions we will meetup again at the beginning of a regular class, present the videos, and choose a winner! The winning group will receive one of the many LEGO® GWP kits.
